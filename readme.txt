== Description ==

Ad Coder is an easy way to spread adserver banner code or other html/js code over your blog or page content - e.g. type {IMU 486_60} and this tag will be replaced with the code you have prepared in the admin option panel for this. All important IMU - banner specifications - like full, half, retical and square banner,button 1 and 2 and the micro bar - can be used easily.

You can use the tags for:
* plain text substitution
* html
* xhtml
* javascript

and combinations of the items above.

why is it so good to use this instead of clicking the code - tab of the editor and hardcode your banner image code below your post or page content? after a couple of weeks you might intend to replace your favorite banner, many posts are stored in the archives and... this might be a nightmare, to switch all posts to publish the new favorite banner... but by using ad coder it is simple and easy. just go to your admin panel and switch the banner code of the tag you want to replace. that is it.

in the end ad coder is nothing more than a layer between banner(code) and published posts and pages. maybe you have more than 1.000 posts in stock, then it would be great to prepare for all the new banner code in ONE step.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin free for commercial use? =

yes. only changing the code is strictly permitted.

= Does it support my favorite language? =

version 1 supports english and german. go to http://www.triologic.de/2007/12/29/ad-coder-version1/ and have a look, if there are more language-files for download. if you are able to translate such a locale *.mo file, store it in your blog an create a comment in our TRIOLOGIC blog.

= Shit. This code has damaged my nice strict- xhtml - code, hasn't it? =

Sorry. NO! Whatever you prepare in the admin panel will be delivered directly whithout testing or validation. if you lost `/` in linebreak-tags or img-tags, it is up to you to fix this yourself. let me say: **YOU** are the admin.
